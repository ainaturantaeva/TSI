He even told a judge in 1999 that he feels like a shotgun is inside his mouth and he is holding the trigger. He likes that gun metal taste, so he cannot stop.

                    Explaining his abusive relationship with drugs, Robert said that his father was a drug addict and used to give him the same thing. That's why he has been consuming drugs since he was 8. There have been several occasions where Robert has abused drugs, done something unethical, and called for a hearing. All that time, he wasn't getting anywhere with his career and even got fired from places where he got the opportunity.</p>
